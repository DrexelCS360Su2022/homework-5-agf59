## Problem 4: Homework statistics

Please let us know how much time you spent on each problem. You may enter time using any format described [here](https://github.com/wroberts/pytimeparse). Please put your time estimates *on the same line* as the problem label, not on the following line.

Problem 1: 107m
1.1 was very easy, just mod and div.
1.2 was a bit harder, but I figured out a simple way of doing things by just appending the last digit as a list instead of consing it, since that solved the typing issue between Integer and [Integer]
1.3 was harder still, and I had to apply helper functions as suggested in addition to reviewing lecture notes about splitting functions into elements cons'd to other elements
1.4 was also still harder, and I had to get a bit creative on my algorithm for it. Still nothing that made me pull my hair out
1.5 was pretty easy, but I ran into issues where I wasn't getting the correct answer from the examples on the homework pdf. Clarification received from TA 

Problem 2: 68m
pow, g, and h were all very easy to implement as their pseudocode was basically described in perfectly clear terms from the outset.
d was a bit more tricky, if only because I was struggling to understand the logic behind it. I wound up having to look up examples of partial application but after I saw one it immediately clicked

Problem 3: 138m
I only understood the base case of this assignment and the type constraints, but I was unable to apply the inductive case
